			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I am a junior at the University of Michigan majoring in Information. I'm interested in sports analytics and data analysis. My work in and out of the classroom has given me valuable experience for a career in sports or outside of it.</p>
			<!-- <img src="images/helmets.jpeg" id = 'helmets' alt='competition'> -->
			<!-- <img src="images/table.jpeg" id='table' alt = 'on field'> -->
			<p>I have worked with Michigan Men's Lacrosse for all three years I've been on campus. My freshman year I worked as a student manager, assisting with practice and game operations and travelling with the team. For the past two years I've worked as a data analyst for the team. I work with Catapult, a motion tracking technology that the athletes wear for every practice, game, and conditioning session.</p>
			<p>For these sessions I live track the data to ensure that it is properly labeled for more extensive analysis behind the scenes. After each practice the data is synced and parsed into usable segments. The collect we collect is then used to plan practices and monitor the workload of our athletes. I report directly to Head Coach Kevin Conry, Assistant Coaches Justin Turri, Jim Rogalski, and Chris Harren, and Strength and Conditioning Coach Tommy Gayfield.</p>
			<p>I use the Pandas and Numpy libraries of python to parse through the .csv files of daily activities and aggregated data. I help to regiment practices through load management, using load averages for specific drills to allow coaches to plan practices for specific days of the week. During practices and game I live track the data and provide upates to coaches on loads of specific players and the team as a whole. This is a good failsafe in the event that the team is doing too much or too little on any given day.</p>
